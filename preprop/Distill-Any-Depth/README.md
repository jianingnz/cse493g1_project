We present Distill-Any-Depth, a new SOTA monocular depth estimation model trained with our proposed knowledge distillation algorithms. Models with various sizes are available in this repo.

![teaser](data/teaser/depthmap.png)

## News
- **2025-03-08:** We release the small size of our model based on DAv2.
- **2025-03-02:** Our demo is updated to GPU version. Enjoy it! We also include the Gradio demo code in this repo.
- **2025-02-26:ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥** Paper, project page, code, models, and demos are  released.

## TODO
- [ ] Release evaluation and training code.
- [ ] Release additional models in various sizes.

## Pre-trained Models

We provide **two models** of varying scales for robust relative depth estimation:

## Getting Started

We recommend setting up a virtual environment to ensure package compatibility. You can use miniconda to set up the environment. The following steps show how to create and activate the environment, and install dependencies:

```bash
# Create a new conda environment with Python 3.10
conda create -n distill-any-depth -y python=3.10

# Activate the created environment
conda activate distill-any-depth

# Install the required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Navigate to the Detectron2 directory and install it
cd detectron2
pip install -e .

cd ..
pip install -e .
```

To download pre-trained checkpoints follow the code snippet below:


### Running from commandline

We provide a helper script to run the model on a single image directly:
```bash
# Run prediction on a single image using the helper script
source scripts/00_infer.sh
# or use bash
bash scripts/00_infer.sh
```

```bash
# you should download the pretrained model and input the path on the '--checkpoint'

# Define the GPU ID and models you wish to run
GPU_ID=0
model_list=('xxx')  # List of models you want to test

# Loop through each model and run inference
for model in "${model_list[@]}"; do
    # Run the model inference with specified parameters
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=${GPU_ID} \
    python tools/testers/infer.py \
        --seed 1234 \  # Set random seed for reproducibility
        --checkpoint 'checkpoint/large/model.safetensors' \  # Path to the pre-trained model checkpoint
        --processing_res 700 \ 
        --output_dir output/${model} \  # Directory to save the output results
        --arch_name 'depthanything-large' \  # [depthanything-large, depthanything-base]
done
```

## Use from transformers
Here is how to use this model to perform zero-shot depth estimation:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
from PIL import Image
import requests
# load pipe
pipe = pipeline(task="depth-estimation", model="xingyang1/Distill-Any-Depth-Large-hf")
# load image
url = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg'
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)
# inference
depth = pipe(image)["depth"]
```
We are sincerely grateful to [@keetrap](https://github.com/keetrap) and [@Niels Rogge](https://huggingface.co/nielsr) for their huge efforts in supporting our models in Transformers.

## Gradio demo
We also include the Gradio demo code, Please clone the project and set up the environment using pip install.

```bash
# Create a new conda environment with Python 3.10
conda create -n distill-any-depth -y python=3.10

# Activate the created environment
conda activate distill-any-depth

# Install the required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install -e .
```
Make sure you can connect to Hugging Face, or use the local path. (app.py)
```bash
# if use hf_hub_download, you can use the following code
checkpoint_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id=f"xingyang1/Distill-Any-Depth", filename=f"large/model.safetensors", repo_type="model")

# if use local path, you can use the following code
# checkpoint_path = "path/to/your/model.safetensors"
```
in the end, 
```bash
python app.py
